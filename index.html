                being a farmer has always been my dream. I had the chance to met with many top notch businessman in
                Asia,
                especially government representatives and international traders, which gave me a lot of insights into
                the business world(although it's much harder than I expected).

                Thanks to my little well-off family, I had the chance to get in touch with computer much earlier than
                other kids in China, which was half-half a curse and a blessing. Due to excessive screen-time, I am now
                suffering from several severe eye diseases, but I also got the chance to learn programming and computer
                science,
                which I am gratful for.

                Personally, I make some robots(must watch on the website!), and I do some day trading(god i hate options), and a little gardening for food justice, these
              three things are basically all I do besides golf and KFC with my friends.
             I love to spend my time on C&O(Combinatorics and Optimization), it's just like my golfing, I suck at it, but I love it! YOLOed 80% of my electives on C&O courses, which is the only thing I felt worth my tuition for.

            That's it, that's my life. One last thing I think really cool to mention is that I learned my English conversational skill from watching South Park(not recommended for kids).
