        <div class="body-text">The "Spider-Robo" project is an innovative endeavor where a live spider robot was created using a Raspberry Pi and extensive 3D printing. The project involved replicating a design from a genius inventor, and the implementation required meticulous assembly of 3D printed parts, programming the Raspberry Pi to control the robot's movements, and integrating sensors for real-time interaction. The result is a fully functional spider robot that showcases the power of combining hardware and software in a creative way.</div>

  This project was originally from
  <a class="styled-link" href="https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Raspberry-Pi-Spider-Robot-Platform/">Morris14</a>.
</div>      I made it with the help from Laurier Makerspace for 3D printing and circuit design. The project was a great learning experience for me as it involved a wide range of skills, including 3D printing, electronics, and programming. I had to learn how to design and print 3D parts, solder and assemble electronic components, and write code to control the robot's movements. The project also required a lot of patience and attention to detail, as even small mistakes could cause the robot to malfunction. Overall, I am proud of the final result and the skills I developed along the way.</div>
