      The "Non-GAAP" project is a comprehensive initiative that focuses on non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) financial measures. The project leverages Python for data extraction, processing, and analysis. The main objective is to extract and analyze the adjusted EBITDA used in company filings.
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="body-text">
      The project starts with the extraction of financial data from various sources using Python's powerful libraries. The extracted data is then processed and structured into a usable format for further analysis.
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="body-text">
      The processed data is then used to identify and extract the adjusted EBITDA used in company filings. The analysis is designed to be easily understandable, allowing users to quickly grasp the differences and similarities between non-GAAP and GAAP measures.
    </div>
    <hr>
    <div class="body-text">
      The results of the analysis are then written to an Excel file named 'demo.xlsx'. This file contains the detailed extraction of adjusted EBITDA, including the corresponding year, amount, and account associated with each adjusted EBITDA. This allows users to easily access the results and use them for their own financial analysis or research.

    <div class="body-text">
      In summary, the "Non-GAAP" project is a robust tool that demystifies non-GAAP financial measures. It combines efficient data processing with detailed financial analysis, and provides an informative Excel output, resulting in a tool that is both informative and easy to use.
